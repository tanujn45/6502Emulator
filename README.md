## Installation

In order to run the Emulator clone the repository and open a terminal. Change into project directory and run the command ```make run```. It will start the terminal based debugger.

In order to load another program, get the hexdump of your program from any 6502 Assembler online and update it in the main.cpp file. You can also update the area of RAM that you are outputting by updating the ```printRam``` function. It takes a ```startAddr``` and an ```endAddr```.
